# Personal Blog Project 
    a simple blog project created with laravel php. 
    
## Config
    The user.php file on the app folder is a model. as laravel follows the MVC concept so user.php behaves as a model. 
    the controllers are in the app>http>controllers folder. the views are in the resources folder. 
    all the views uses the blade template engine. 

    > How views work, the pages to view are all in the web.php or we can say on the routes folder.
    we just return a page here. like we return the view here and it just serches the desired function on the views folder.
