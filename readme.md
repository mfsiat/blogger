### Features 

* Front Page: Its a dynamic front page. There are options to savve username and his or her specific to-do's. An user can use its homepage to save their to-do's and they can easily remember the todo's from the homepgae. It's just like an extension of chrome's momentum. 

- About US: well it's just a normal page nothing special about this page but i have plans to use it as a portofolio page well viewers can easily see my portofolio by watching this page. 

- Github: Well this one is my favourite. On this page all my latest public repo's are getting fetched from github. So that the viewer can easily see my github page at a glance. It's also using the **github public API**.

- Blog: This page shows all my blog posts. Well the main reason for creating this blog or website.
