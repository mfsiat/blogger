## Features 

* **Front Page**: Previously there was options for saving username and todo on the front page, but now removed that and made it simple by just showing the time and greetings. 

- **About US**: well it's just a normal page nothing special about this page but i have plans to use it as a portfolio page well viewers can easily see my portfolio by watching this page. 

- **Github**: Well this one is my favorite. On this page all my latest public repo's are getting fetched from github. So that the viewer can easily see my github page at a glance. It's also using the **github public API**.

- **Blog**: This page shows all my blog posts. Well the main reason for creating this blog or website. [This feature has become obsolete due to my hosting platform issue]() 

    
## Extras 

- Add the *CLIENT_ID* & *CLIENT_SECRET* for github search api
